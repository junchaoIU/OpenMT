You can get the other bilingual-dictionaries from MUSE:
- https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE#ground-truth-bilingual-dictionaries

Put the bilingual-dictionaries you need under the folder **pair_dict**, and run the script:
```shell
python3 Scripts/generate_dict.py Dictionaries/pair_dict
```

Then, you could get a new dictionary **dict.json**
